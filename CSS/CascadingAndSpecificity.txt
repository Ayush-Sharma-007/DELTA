CSS : Cascading Style Sheets

CASCADING

What is Cascading in CSS?
The CSS Cascade algorithm's job is to select CSS declarations in order to determine the correct values for CSS properties.

Eg: 
h2{
    background-color: yellow;
}

h2{
    background-color: blue;
}

Here the final color will be blue due to cascading.

This is applicable even if there are multiple stylesheets. It would apply the properties of the stylesheet linked last.


SELECTOR SPECIFICITY

What is specificity?
Specificity is an algorithm that calculates the weight that is applied to a given CSS declaration.

It gives a three digit number which show the impact of a CSS Delcaration.

Id selector > class selector, attribute selector and pseudo classes > element selector and pseudo elements

Examples : 
1. h2 {
    background-color: yellow;
}

Here we only have an element selector so its specificity will be 001.

2. .myclass:hover{
    color: blue;
}

Here we have a class selector and a pseudo-class so its specificity will be 020.

This shows that the CSS declaration in the second example will be 20 times more impactful than the CSS declaration in  first example.

IMPORTANT : 1. USING MORE SELECTORS IS BETTER THAN USING LESS SELECTORS.
2. IF TWO CSS DECLARATIONS HAVE THE SAME SPECIFICITY THEN WE CHECK THE CASCADING OF THE DECLARATIONS.
3. INLINE STYLING HAS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY AMONG ALL.
4. IF ANY CSS DECLARATION HAS !Important WRITTEN THEN ITS PRIORITY BECOMES MORE THAN EVEN THE INLINE STYLING AND IT BECOMES IMMUTABLE.
5. INPUT BOXES AND BUTTONS BY DEFAULT DO NOT INHERIT ANY PROPERTY FROM THEIR PARENT ELEMENTS.
